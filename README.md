Student_Performance_Prediction
ML project to predict student math scores using Python and Linear Regression

Student Performance Prediction:

Predict students' math scores based on features like reading score, writing score, gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).

Dataset:
- 1000 student records
- Features: Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch, Test Prep, Reading Score, Writing Score
- Target: Math Score

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

How to Run:
Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code and execute the cells. Ensure `StudentsPerformance.csv` is in the same folder.
